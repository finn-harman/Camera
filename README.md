# Camera

In this project,Â I have written code for a component of a simple digital camera. The camera has two external controls, the power switch, and the shutter release.

The central component is the Camera, it is responsible for responding to user actions from the camera controls, and co-ordinating the transfer of data from the sensor to the memory card when a photograph is taken. I have developed the Camera class in a test-driven style, adding one test at a time to CameraTest.
